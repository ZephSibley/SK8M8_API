1) Use blob storage on Azure

2) Accept user provided file in body of media submission

3) Generate Guid (Guid.NewGuid.ToString()) to use as filename for user provided file (to ensure unique)

4) Upload user provided file to Azure blob storage with the filename generated in 3)

5) Create a Media record with the Guid in it (so you can retrieve the file again later)

6) User can get the file from the Id by querying a download endpoint (eg: /Media/Retrieve/1). This will retrieve the record and use the attached Guid to locate and return the file
